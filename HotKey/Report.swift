/// way to deal with it. And if we have to deal with this, we have to
/// abandon OO design, which is highly undesired.
///
/// This facility provides a way to report such errors and give you a last
/// change to handle and quit program gracefully. Considering fatality of these
/// errors, there's usually no way to recover, graceful quit is would be the
/// best effort.
